# Custom Mobs

This sample demonstrates two ideas for a framework for managing the lifetime of objects for entities and script components.

## Prerequisites

**Install Node.js tools, if you haven't already**

We're going to use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to get more tools to make the process of building our project easier.

Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

Download the version with "LTS" next to the number and install it. (LTS stands for Long Term Support, if you're curious.) In the Node.js Windows installer, accept the installation defaults. You do not need to install any additional tools for Native compilation.

**Install Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already**

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install Visual Studio Code.

## Manifest

- [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-scripting-samples/blob/main/ts-starter/gulpfile.js): This file contains build instructions for Gulp, for building out TypeScript code.
- [scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-scripting-samples/blob/main/ts-starter/scripts): This contains all of your TypeScript files, that will be compiled and built into your projects.
- [behavior_packs](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-scripting-samples/blob/main/ts-starter/behavior_packs): This contains resources and JSON files that define your behavior pack.
